I am a **Postdoctoral Research Economist** at the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/" target="_blank">`London School of Economics`</a> within the <a href="https://cep.lse.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Centre for Economic Performance</a>.

**I am on the academic job market this fall 2024/2025.**

My research interests are in **intergenerational mobility**, in particular its *measurement* and *spatial variations*, the underlying *mechanisms* and the *policies* that can help remediate such intergenerational inequalities. In this spirit, I have undertaken work on **educational inequalities**.

I obtained my **PhD in Economics** in Nov. 2023 from <a href="https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/en.html" target="_blank">`Sciences Po`</a>, under the delightful supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pierrephilippecombes" target="_blank">`Pierre-Philippe Combes`</a>.  During the 2022-23 academic year, I was a research fellow at PSE's <a href="https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/pse-partnership-programme/chairs/education-policy-and-social-mobility-chair/" target="_blank">`Education Policy and Social Mobility Chair`</a>.
