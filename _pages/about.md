I am an **Assistant Professor of Economics** at <a href="https://thema.u-cergy.fr/?lang=fr" target="_blank">`CY Cergy Paris University (THEMA)`</a>. I am also a Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.ipp.eu/" target="_blank">Institut des Politiques Publiques</a> and an Associate at CEP (LSE).

Previously, I was a postdoctoral research economist at the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/" target="_blank">`London School of Economics`</a> within the <a href="https://cep.lse.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Centre for Economic Performance</a>. I obtained my **PhD in Economics** in Nov. 2023 from <a href="https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/en.html" target="_blank">`Sciences Po`</a>, under the delightful supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pierrephilippecombes" target="_blank">`Pierre-Philippe Combes`</a>.

My research interests are in **intergenerational mobility**, in particular its *measurement* and *spatial variations*, the underlying *mechanisms* and the *policies* that can help remediate such intergenerational inequalities. In this spirit, I have undertaken work on **educational inequalities**.

You can find my CV <a href="assets/pdf/kenedi_cv.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
