  abstract={Little is known about what influences high-achieving, low-income students' persistence in higher education, despite extensive work on their enrolment decision. This paper investigates the role of credit constraints. Using exhaustive administrative data for France, I estimate the impact of automatically granting generous additional aid to enrolled high-achieving, low-income students. Eligibility is communicated too late to affect initial enrolment, allowing me to recover the pure effect on the intensive margin. I find this aid had precisely estimated null effects on persistence, graduation, and did not induce switches to higher quality degrees. This suggests high-achieving students may be less sensitive to financial aid than their lower performing peers.},

  title={Older Schoolmate Spillovers on Higher Education Choices},
  author={Kenedi, Gustave, and Bechichi, Nagui},
  year={2024},
   abstract={How do students choose where to apply to higher education? Answering this question is important because the returns to higher education differ greatly across majors and institutions. This paper examines a previously overlooked factor shaping these choices: the high school environment. Specifically, we analyze how students' applications and enrollments are influenced by the higher education trajectory of recent graduates from their high school. Exploiting random admission cutoffs in France's centralized admission system, we compare high schools where older schoolmates were marginally admitted versus rejected from specific degrees (subject-institution combination). Our findings reveal significant older schoolmate spillovers: students are 6 percentage points (+19%) more likely to apply to and 2 percentage points (+45%) more likely to enroll in the same degree as a marginally enrolled older schoolmate. These effects are large, corresponding to roughly 45% of spillovers across siblings estimated in other countries. We find both teacher influence and homophily/role model effects mediate these cross-cohort spillovers. Lastly, we quantify the extent to which exposure to high-achieving older schoolmates affects the socioeconomic gap in applications to very selective degrees and find that equalizing this exposure would narrow the gap by around 10%. These results demonstrate how inequalities in higher education can be perpetuated or mitigated through high school peer networks.},
